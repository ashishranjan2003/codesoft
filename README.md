Completed Task 1: "TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION" for CodSoft Internship! "I'm excited to share my first project on Titanic survival prediction . I completed this project during my internship at CodSoft, I used Python and machine learning to predict the survival of Titanic passengers. My model achieved an accuracy of 80%, which is significantly higher than the baseline accuracy of 50%. I used a variety of features, including passenger class, sex, age, and fare, to train my model. I also explored the data to identify any interesting patterns. For example, I found that passengers in first class were more likely to survive than passengers in third class. I also found that female passengers were more likely to survive than male passengers. I'm excited to share my findings with the community and to continue learning about machine learning." Here are some additional details that you can include in the caption: 1.The dataset used for this project is the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster dataset, which is available on Kaggle. 2.The machine learning algorithm used for this project is a random forest classifier. 3.This project was inspired by the work of other data scientists who have used machine learning to predict the survival of Titanic passengers.
